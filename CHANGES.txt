TO DO
    - class inheritence and scope for referenced modules.
    - Position precision from stage? (See fsmm() method).  Also fs precision, set in delays()
    - Analysis code to expand: sample sizes (pow2), recon types (blind and SHG only at the moment) and parameters (currently hard-coded)
    - Generalise to other spectrometers & stages.  Via unified hardware IO interface layer...?

    04/12/18    v0.4
                Converted to standard package structure, may have broken some things
                Added optional module loading for hardware layer
                Tidied up a little bit
                NEEDS TESTING.

    18/11/18    v0.3 packaged
                Implemented ".frg" save type, Trebino group Frog format
                Implemented

    19/09/18    Fixed issues with recon and interpolation.
                STILL A LITTLE CHECKING to do here - possible data-flipping...?

    06/09/18    v0.2 packaged
                Added frog.spec() for spectrometer free-run
                All working aside from recon image plotting when interpolated...?
    27/08/18    Tided up recon code & interp routine, making use of crop()
    24/08/18    Added subclasses for plot and recon data (structures)
                Finished implementing plotting routines
                Fixed recon data-size issues
    21/08/18    Added basic data save and read (pickle only)
